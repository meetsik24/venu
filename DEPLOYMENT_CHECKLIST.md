- [x] TypeScript errors resolved
- [x] All dependencies installed
- [x] No hardcoded data remaining
- [x] Environment variables properly configured

### ✅ Database Setup
- [ ] Create Neon database account
- [ ] Set up database tables (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [ ] Test database connection

- [ ] Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Configure build settings (auto-detected for Next.js)

### 3. Database Configuration
- [ ] Run SQL schema in Neon dashboard
- [ ] Test database connection from Vercel
- [ ] Verify tables are created correctly

### 4. Deployment
- [ ] Trigger deployment in Vercel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**
   - Check TypeScript errors
   - Verify all imports are correct
   - Check for missing dependencies

2. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Check if database is accessible
   - Ensure SSL is enabled

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify JWT_SECRET is set
   - Check token generation/verification
   - Test login/logout flow

4. **Environment Variable Issues**
   - Verify all required variables are set
   - Check variable names match exactly
   - Ensure no typos in values

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Set up error tracking (optional)
- [ ] Monitor build times

## Security Checklist

- [x] No unused dependencies
- [x] Images are optimized
- [x] Code splitting is working

### ✅ Runtime Performance
- [x] Pages load quickly
- [x] Database queries are efficient
- [x] No memory leaks
- [x] Proper error handling

## Final Verification

### ✅ Complete User Journey
